# Animated Navigation

https://thedanitor.github.io/animated_navigation/

This project is from the Day 14 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have heavily commented the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what each line of code does.

### Overall Impression

Very stylish nav animation. I kept the outline on the icon focus for accessibility. When I did that I noticed that the X was not centered in the button, so had to play around with the individual line positionings of the active class to make it look better. Sometimes there is a trade-off between design, functionality, and accessibility, but I am working to create a good balance.

### Things Learned

* Can specify percentage of space to fill for linear gradient
* list-style-type can be used to specify the type of list marker (none removes marker entirely)
* The difference between outline and border. Outline is drawn outside the element's border and is not part of element's dimentions https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_outline.asp
